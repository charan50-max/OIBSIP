🔐 OIBSIP – Cybersecurity Internship Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey during the Oasis Infobyte Security Analyst Internship Program.
The internship is designed to provide practical exposure to real-world cybersecurity concepts through technical tasks, research work, security testing, and professional documentation.

Each task in this repository includes:

A fully structured GitHub submission with relevant scripts, configuration files, reports and documentation

A demonstration video for practical implementations

Clear explanations of findings, risks and remediation strategies

The goal of this project is not only to complete internship requirements, but to develop the mindset and discipline of a cybersecurity professional by applying theoretical concepts in controlled real-world environments.

🎯 Purpose of the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to:

Build strong foundational knowledge in cybersecurity operations

Practice industry-relevant tools and security methodologies

Understand how vulnerabilities arise and how they can be mitigated

Learn proper security documentation and reporting standards

Create a long-term learning portfolio for academic and professional growth

Each task reflects a core domain of cybersecurity such as network scanning, firewall configuration, traffic analysis, vulnerability exploitation and full security assessment.

### 📁 Internship Tasks Overview

| Task No. | Task Title | Description | Key Tools | Main Files |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **1** | Basic Network Scanning with Nmap | Performed a detailed network scan on the local system to identify open ports, services and potential security risks. | Nmap | nmap_scan_results.txt, screenshots, README |
| **2** | Basic Firewall Configuration using UFW | Configured a Linux firewall by allowing SSH, blocking HTTP and verifying security rules for system protection. | UFW | ufw_configuration.sh, screenshots, README |
| **8** | Network Traffic Capture with Wireshark | Captured and analyzed live network packets, filtered HTTP traffic and studied client-server communication. | Wireshark, Npcap | wireshark_capture.pcap, README |
| **9** | SQL Injection Exploitation on DVWA | Demonstrated an SQL injection vulnerability on DVWA in a controlled lab environment and documented remediation steps. | DVWA, XAMPP, MySQL | sql_injection_exploit.sh, demo video, README |
| **10** | Network Security Assessment Report | Conducted a full security assessment using Nmap and Wireshark, identified vulnerabilities and proposed security improvements. | Nmap, Wireshark | network_security_assessment.md, scan files, capture files |

🧠 Key Learnings Achieved

Through these tasks, I gained practical understanding of:

How open ports and exposed services create attack surfaces

How firewalls protect systems when correctly configured

How network packets reveal the internal behavior of applications

How SQL Injection vulnerabilities occur due to insecure coding practices

How security assessments identify risks and guide remediation

How professional security reports are structured and communicated

Most importantly, I learned how small configuration mistakes can lead to serious security risks and how layered security controls help in defending systems effectively.

🚀 Future Endeavors

This repository is the foundation of my long-term growth in cybersecurity.
In the future, I plan to expand this work by:

Practicing advanced penetration testing techniques

Exploring malware analysis and digital forensics

Learning cloud security and infrastructure protection

Working on bug bounty programs and vulnerability research

Contributing to open-source security projects

This repository will continue to evolve as I strengthen my skills and deepen my understanding of cybersecurity as a discipline.
