# Social Engineering Attacks – Research Report

## 1. Introduction

Social engineering is one of the most dangerous and successful forms of cyber attack. Unlike technical attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits human behavior. Attackers manipulate people into revealing confidential information, transferring money, or granting system access. Because it targets human trust rather than code, social engineering remains effective even when strong technical security controls are in place.

This report studies the major types of social engineering attacks, explains how they work, presents real-world case studies, analyzes their impact on organizations, and provides practical recommendations to prevent such attacks.



## 2. Understanding Social Engineering

Social engineering is the practice of influencing individuals to perform actions or disclose information by using psychological manipulation. Attackers commonly exploit fear, curiosity, urgency, authority, or sympathy to control the victim’s decision making.

The typical social engineering attack follows this pattern:

1. Information gathering about the target  
2. Building trust or creating urgency  
3. Manipulating the victim’s emotions  
4. Executing the exploit  
5. Disappearing before detection  



## 3. Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 3.1 Phishing

Phishing is the most common social engineering attack. Attackers send fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate. The goal is to steal credentials, financial information, or install malware.

Common phishing variants include:

Email phishing where attackers impersonate banks, companies, or coworkers  
Spear phishing which targets specific individuals  
Whaling which targets senior executives  
Smishing using SMS messages  
Vishing using phone calls  

Example:
An email claims your account will be suspended and asks you to click a link to verify your password. The link leads to a fake login page that steals your credentials.



### 3.2 Pretexting

Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information. The attacker pretends to be someone trustworthy such as an IT employee, auditor, HR officer, or government official.

The victim believes the story and provides confidential information.

Example:
An attacker calls an employee claiming to be from IT support and requests the employee’s login credentials for “system maintenance.”



### 3.3 Baiting

Baiting exploits human curiosity. Attackers offer something attractive such as free software, USB drives, movie downloads, or job offers. When the victim interacts with the bait, malware is installed or data is stolen.

Example:
USB drives labeled “Salary Details” are left in a parking lot. An employee plugs one into their office computer and unknowingly infects the corporate network.



### 3.4 Tailgating

Tailgating occurs when an attacker physically follows authorized personnel into restricted areas by pretending to belong there.

Example:
An attacker carrying boxes follows an employee into a secured building after asking them to hold the door.



### 3.5 Quid Pro Quo

The attacker offers a service or benefit in exchange for information.

Example:
An attacker offers free technical support in exchange for system login details.



## 4. Case Studies and Real World Incidents

### Case Study 1: Target Data Breach 2013

Attackers sent phishing emails to a third party HVAC contractor. The contractor’s credentials were stolen. The attackers then accessed Target’s internal network and stole data of over 40 million customers.

Impact:
Severe financial loss  
Reputation damage  
CEO resignation  
Billions in legal and security costs  



### Case Study 2: Twitter Bitcoin Scam 2020

Attackers used phone based social engineering to trick Twitter employees into giving access credentials. High-profile accounts like Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Apple were compromised.

Impact:
Global embarrassment for Twitter  
Loss of user trust  
Regulatory scrutiny  
Major internal security reforms  



### Case Study 3: Google and Facebook Fraud 2013–2015

A Lithuanian attacker impersonated a hardware vendor and sent fake invoices to Google and Facebook. Employees processed the payments believing they were legitimate.

Impact:
Loss of over 100 million dollars  
International investigation  
Criminal conviction  



### Case Study 4: Ubiquiti Networks 2015

The finance department received emails from attackers impersonating senior executives requesting urgent wire transfers.

Impact:
Loss of 46 million dollars  
Share price drop  
Severe investor concern  



## 5. Impact of Social Engineering on Organizations

Financial losses  
Legal penalties  
Loss of customer trust  
Operational disruption  
Data theft and intellectual property loss  
Long term brand damage  

Unlike technical attacks, social engineering attacks are harder to detect because the victim often believes they are acting correctly.



## 6. Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

### 6.1 Security Awareness Training

Regular employee training is the strongest defense. Staff must learn how to recognize phishing emails, suspicious requests, and manipulation techniques.

### 6.2 Multi-Factor Authentication

Even if credentials are stolen, MFA prevents attackers from accessing systems.

### 6.3 Clear Communication Policies

Organizations must define how sensitive information is requested and transferred. Employees should know that passwords or OTPs are never shared.

### 6.4 Verification Procedures

Sensitive requests must be verified using a second communication channel. A phone call or internal confirmation prevents many fraud cases.

### 6.5 Email and Web Filtering

Advanced email filters block phishing emails. Web filtering prevents access to malicious websites.

### 6.6 Incident Response Planning

Employees should know exactly what to do when they suspect a social engineering attempt. Fast reporting minimizes damage.



## 7. Conclusion

Social engineering remains one of the most powerful tools in a cybercriminal’s arsenal because it exploits human behavior rather than technical flaws. As long as humans remain part of security systems, social engineering will continue to be a threat.

Organizations must treat employee awareness as seriously as firewalls and encryption. Technology can reduce risk, but educated and alert employees are the strongest defense against social engineering attacks.
