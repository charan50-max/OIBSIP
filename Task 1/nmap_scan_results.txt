Target: 127.0.0.1
Date: 31 Dec 2025
Scan Type: Intense Scan

Open Ports and Services:

135/tcp   - Microsoft Windows RPC
445/tcp   - Microsoft-DS (SMB File Sharing)

3306/tcp  - MySQL Database Server 8.0.44
7778/tcp  - Interwise service

Key Observations:

• System is running Windows with SMB and RPC services active.
• MySQL database is running locally on port 3306.
• Web-based services detected on ports 1042 and 1043.
• Multiple open ports increase attack surface if exposed externally.

Security Implications:

Open ports represent potential entry points for attackers.  
Critical services such as SMB (445) and MySQL (3306) should be restricted using firewall rules and strong authentication.
