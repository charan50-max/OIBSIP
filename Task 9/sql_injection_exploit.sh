echo "-----------------------------------------------"

echo "Step 1: Normal query"
echo "Input used: 1"
echo "Expected result: One user record"

echo "Step 2: Injection test"
echo "Input used: 1 OR 1=1"
echo "Expected result: Multiple user records returned"

echo "Conclusion:"
echo "The application is vulnerable because it directly inserts user input into SQL queries."
echo "Mitigation: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries."
